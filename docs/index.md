# MRI User Manual

From Ben Inglis:
> Some of the information presented is useful stuff that will help you get the best data and run efficient scan sessions. This isn’t designed to be a standalone training course, but a reference to explain some of the features and terms you will come across as you learn to drive the scanner. It should be considered supporting information only. Accordingly, I don’t recommend trying to read this document until you have run the scanner for yourself a couple of times at least. I assume a reasonable familiarity with the scanner software and control. It is also essential to have some knowledge of the background physics and physiology of fMRI.
