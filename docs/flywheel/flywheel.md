# Flywheel

## Overview

According to [Flywheel's documentation](https://docs.flywheel.io/hc/en-us):

> Flywheel is a research data platform that provides the tools needed for data import, automated curation, image processing, machine learning workflows, and secure collaboration.

CHN uses Flywheel as the method of hosting and storing the raw fMRI data that comes off the scanner. Flywheel is also capable of organizing data (i.e, [BIDS curation](./bids-curation.md)) and preprocessing data (i.e., [fMRIPrep](./fmriprep.md) on its host server.

We encourage users to read Flywheel's documentation site to gain a deeper understanding of Flywheel's purpose and capabilities.
