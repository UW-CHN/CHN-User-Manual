# Computational resources

This section will discuss options for computing with neuroimaging data.

There are several options for computing:

1. You can buy the hardware you need and stash it in your lab. Also known as the "server in a closet" solution. This is not generally recommended.

2. Buy hardware and put it in a rack (that you rent) in UW-IT's data center. This is a relatively cost effective way of doing things, but *only if you have substantial system administration knowledge and experience*.

3. On premise high-performance computing. This is described in the [hyak](./hyak.md) section.

4. Cloud computing: use public cloud computing vendors. This is described in the [cloud](./cloud.md) section.
